Consider the following C program:
```
{{ code }}
```

You are allowed to use implication to take care of the conditional nature of the code. Use implication (==>) instead of using if-then.

For all variables, add conjunctions that bound the maximum and minimum values that they can take, if such bounds exist.

If a variable is always equal to or smaller or larger than another variable, add a conjunction for their relation.

If the assertion is guarded by a condition, use the guard condition in an implication.

If certain variables are non-deterministic at the beginning or end of the loop, use an implication to make the invariant trivially true at that location. 

Output the loop invariants for the loop in the program above. Let's think step by step.
